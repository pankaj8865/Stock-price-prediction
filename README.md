# Stock-price-prediction
# A simple deep learning model for stock price prediction using TensorFlow
We scraped minutely S&P 500 data from the Google Finance API. The data consisted of index as well as stock prices of the S&Pâ€™s 500 constituents. Having this data at hand, the idea of developing a deep learning model for predicting the S&P 500 index is based on the 500 constituents prices.

Note, that this project is a hands-on tutorial on TensorFlow. Actual prediction of stock prices is a really challenging and complex task that requires tremendous efforts, especially at higher frequencies, such as minutes used here.

# Conclusion and Outlook :
The release of TensorFlow was a landmark event in deep learning research. Its flexibility and performance allows researchers to develop all kinds of sophisticated neural network architectures as well as other ML algorithms. However, flexibility comes at the cost of longer time-to-model cycles compared to higher level APIs such as Keras or MxNet.
